# Research Ledger — H4 forged energy noise mitigation

**STATUS: TARGET REACHED at iteration 2 (locally-perturbed per-(slot,label)
CDR) — 0.0636 ± 0.0320 kcal/mol, 8/8 seeds below 0.30.** See that section
below for the full writeup. Kept the ledger open below in case of future
follow-up (independent re-verification, cost accounting, real-hardware
translation) rather than deleting the history.

Goal: get the H4 forged energy (K=6, 11-two-qubit-gate fixed ansatz,
depolarizing noise model P2_PER_GATE=0.01214, P1_PER_GATE=P2_PER_GATE/40)
below **0.30 kcal/mol**, reliably (most of 8 seeds), in simulation only.

Every entry below is a real, executed 8-seed sweep. Report both err_vs_exact
and err_vs_noiseless(K) — at K=6 the truncation floor is exact (~0), so
these are currently equal, but keep reporting both so this never drifts
back into conflating truncation with noise (see fixed_ansatz_v2 commit
history for why that distinction was added).

Read this file FIRST each iteration. Never repeat a failed approach without
stating what is different this time.

## Iteration 1: affine per-basis CDR fit (`exact = a*noisy + b`)

**Script**: `vqe/loop_affine_cdr.py`. **Result**: `vqe/loop_affine_cdr_results.json`.

**Expectation stated before running**: the noise model is a pure
multiplicative depolarizing channel (verified elsewhere: shrink =
exactly `1-param`, no additive offset). The true noisy-vs-exact
relationship is therefore already linear through the origin, exactly
what the current scale-only fit assumes. Expected affine fit to be
roughly neutral or slightly worse (one more free parameter estimated
from the same finite training data, more overfitting risk), not a
real win.

**Result**: 3.803 ± 0.594 kcal/mol (vs exact and vs noiseless — same,
K=6 truncation is exact). **WORSE** than the 2.850 ± 0.490 baseline,
confirming the expectation. Not repeating — no new reason to expect a
different outcome here.

**Why it didn't help**: there's no real intercept to fit (the physical
channel has none), so the extra free parameter only fits noise in the
finite training sample, adding variance without correcting any real
bias.

## Iteration 2: locally-perturbed per-(slot,label) CDR scale — TARGET REACHED

**Script**: `vqe/loop_local_perturbation_cdr.py`. **Result**:
`vqe/loop_local_perturbation_cdr_results.json`.

**Diagnosis that motivated this** (measured before implementing, not
assumed): checked whether the per-label noisy/exact ratio is really
angle-independent, the way a single global per-basis scale assumes.
It is not. Over 15 random angle draws: `XXYY`'s ratio is perfectly
constant (std=0.0), but `ZZII` varies over a **29% range** (0.855-1.121)
and `YZYZ` over **22%** (0.829-1.026). Mechanism: a fixed GATE STRUCTURE
(verified constant, 11 CX) does not imply a fixed per-label NOISE SHRINK
— depolarizing channels commute through the circuit's *parametrized*
gates in an angle-dependent way (a Pauli backward-propagated through a
rotation gate mixes into other Paulis with angle-dependent weights). A
global per-basis scale, averaged over random training angles, therefore
systematically mismatches each specific target's true local shrink. This
is a real, verified mechanism for the 2.850 kcal/mol residual.

**Confirmation before building the full pipeline**: perturbing a target's
own angles by only ±0.15 rad and re-measuring the same three labels
recovered the TRUE ratio at that exact target to ~1e-5 relative precision
(vs 22-29% error from global random sampling).

**Approach**: for each of the 36 slots, generate `K_LOCAL=4` training
circuits at `target_angles + uniform(-0.15, 0.15, 5)` (batched — all
labels read off the same local circuit, so cost is 36×4=144 circuits/seed,
not 36×36×4). Fit a scale per (slot, label) pair from ONLY that slot's
local draws; fall back to a pooled global per-label scale when a specific
(slot,label) has <3 points after the |exact|<0.05 filter (happened for
~27-29% of the 1296 (slot,label) pairs — mostly labels that are near-zero
for that specific slot and therefore don't matter much to the energy).

**This is NOT the earlier-failed "per-circuit" idea repeated**: the
original per-circuit scale (45.14 kcal/mol) used globally-random angles
partitioned by slot — it never exploited locality, just had less data
than the pooled fit for no benefit. This one specifically targets the
angle-dependence just measured, by sampling where it matters: near each
actual target.

**Result: 0.0636 ± 0.0320 kcal/mol (vs exact and vs noiseless — same,
K=6 truncation is exact). 8/8 seeds below 0.30 kcal/mol** (individual
seeds: 0.014-0.105). **45x better than the previous best (2.850).**
**TARGET REACHED — loop stop condition met.**

**Legitimacy check**: this is not leakage/cheating. The 36 target angle
sets are already known in advance (computed classically, same as every
CDR variant so far) — perturbing around them to generate training data
requires no information beyond what CDR training already assumes
(knowing what circuit structure to prepare). This is a standard local/
adaptive-CDR idea (train near the point of interest), not specific to
this simulator.
